Fuz is a zippy stack for digital autonomy.
Today Fuz has a collection of libraries for making modern websites
with TypeScript, CSS, Svelte, and SvelteKit,
and soon they'll be joined by native tools written in Rust.

Fuz aims to resist [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification)
by having no investors or profit motive.
The intent is to form a nonprofit but it's currently only one developer.
This website will eventually have community spaces,
for now see the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/fuzdev/www.fuz.dev/discussions)
to follow along and maybe help out.
